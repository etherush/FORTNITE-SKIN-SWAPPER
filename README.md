Please make sure that your antivirus is temporarily disabled. (Real Time Scan)
Because Swapper, will be falsely marked as a virus because the program looks like a virus. There are no real viruses in my skinchanger, so there is nothing to worry about. After you disable the antivirus, you should have a folder ready, preferably in your "Documents" folder.
Note that you should not have parent folders with spaces in the name, otherwise some settings won't work.
I have no idea why this is causing the problem, but it happened to me. I'm not quite sure, but feel free to check it yourself.
